        <p> Old Law Tenements, tenement buildings built after the Tenement House Act of 1879,
          occupied a twenty-five foot lot and were all built using 'cookie-cutter' plans.
          These Old Law Tenements built almost 142 years ago still exist in New York City. 
          As seen in the bar-graph (right), there are 27K accounted for in NYC, majority in
          the borough of Brooklyn.
