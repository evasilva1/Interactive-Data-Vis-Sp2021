    <h2>NYC DOB Permits Issued</h2>
    <h4>DM, NB & Alt-1 Permits Issued from 2008 to 2021</h4>
    Every year the Department of Buildings issues thousands of construction permits.
    Permits used in this analysis are as follows:  
    <p>DM - Demolition Permits, NB - New Building Permits & Alt-1 - Alteration 1 Permits</p>
    <h5><p>Each of these permits allows for certain types of construction to occur: DM allows the full
      demolition of a building, NB allows the construction of a new building and 
      Alt-1 allows the change of egress and/or occupancy of an existing building. Of course these
      types of construction must meet the NYC Construction Code requirements.
